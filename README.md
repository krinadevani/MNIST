# MNIST Neural Network Comparison

## Introduction

The provided code is an implementation of neural network models (a Convolutional Neural Network - CNN and a Feedforward Neural Network - FNN) for the MNIST dataset, a dataset of handwritten digits. The code is written in Python using the PyTorch library.

## Here's a breakdown of the main components:

1. Dataset Setup: The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including normalization.
2. Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A CNN is defined and trained on the MNIST dataset. The CNN consists of convolutional layers, ReLU activation functions, and fully connected layers. Training and testing procedures are provided.
3. Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) Implementation: Similarly, a FNN is defined and trained on the MNIST dataset. The FNN includes fully connected layers and ReLU activation functions.
4. Model Comparison: The number of parameters for each model is compared. Additionally, the test accuracy and loss for both the CNN and FNN are reported.
5. Analysis and Conclusion: The results are analyzed, and a conclusion is drawn based on the performance and parameter efficiency of the CNN and FNN models on the MNIST dataset.

## Summary
In summary, the code demonstrates the implementation and comparison of two neural network architectures for digit classification on the MNIST dataset, emphasizing the advantages of convolutional layers in image classification tasks.
